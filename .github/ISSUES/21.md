# script timeout not working

**jsalatiel** commented *Sep 5, 2021*

Hi, I am trying to make the script check timeout within 3 seconds, but apparently it is not working.

How to replicate:
Create /tmp/test.sh with the following content:
```
#!/bin/bash
sleep 30
echo DONE
```

Now run
```
 # health-checker_linux_amd64 --log-level debug --script /tmp/test.sh  --script-timeout 3
```

On another session , run:

```
# time curl http://localhost:5500
At least one health check failed
real	0m30,021s
user	0m0,011s
sys	0m0,010s
```
The curl command should give up in 3 seconds, but actually it takes 30 seconds.

The output of health-checker_linux_amd64 shows:
INFO[2021-09-05T17:37:43-03:00] The Health Check will attempt to run the following scripts: [{/tmp/test.sh []}]

It took 30 seconds, even though the timeout should be 3 seconds.
