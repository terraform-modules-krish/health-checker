**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like ARM64 binaries in the release assets.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have considered building it myself for ARM64 however it's much more convenient if I didn't have to.

**Additional context**
This is so that this can be used within ARM64 based docker images.
