# Releases aren't producing OS assets since v0.0.5

**AntWDev** commented *May 16, 2023*

**Describe the bug**
Since release v0.0.5 only the tagged source code is a produced asset rather than the OS binaries. This has broken a local renovate process as the required binaries are no longer available.

**To Reproduce**
Check out https://github.com/gruntwork-io/health-checker/releases/ 

```hcl
// paste code snippets here
```

**Expected behavior**
Releases should (or did) contain OS specific binaries.

**Nice to have**
- [ ] Terminal output
- [ ] Screenshots

**Additional context**
