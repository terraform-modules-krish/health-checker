# configurable timeouts for each check

**sarkis** commented *Feb 28, 2018*

This would be a good feature / improvement, the ability to specify a timeout on each specific check or possibly for all checks. Since ELB/ALB is the main use case - we can start by implementing this with those services in mind.
