# Add limited support for Consul Health Check definitions

**josh-padnick** commented *Dec 15, 2017*

Right now, health-checker is a minimal tool that allows users to specify one or more ports to check via TCP to establish the health of a server. Ideally, health-checker would be more flexible, and allow an arbitrary definition of a health check that it can execute. 

Specifically, Health Checker could implement the following types of [Consul Health Check definitions](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html):

- Script + Interval
- HTTP + Interval
- TCP + Interval

This would allow users to run an arbitrary bash script to return a health definition, or make another HTTP request, or achieve the original functionality of attempting a TCP connectoin, but using a declarative configuration.

As an aside, there's nothing magical about using Consul Health Check definitions. I suggested those because I thought it'd be nice to leverage their docs and concepts versus creating our own. But it's also possible to take an approach similar to https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss. Ideas are welcome on what approach would make the most sense here.
