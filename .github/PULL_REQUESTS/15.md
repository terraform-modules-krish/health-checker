# Added support for single flight checks

**Jawshua** commented *Apr 10, 2019*

Hello there!

This is a quick little addition I whipped up to solve an issue we were having. Our health check script can take a few seconds complete, so this change prevents concurrent incoming status checks from spawning multiple instances of the health check script.

Hi @Jawshua , thanks for the PR!

You seem to have added a test case as well, so I'll run the CI suite and report back how the tests went.

Couple of small things to add. Could you update the README to include the new `--singleflight` option and maybe log the fact that we're using `singleflight`. Something like this: 
`The Health Check will attempt to... in singleflight mode`
