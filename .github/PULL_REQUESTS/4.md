# Various improvements following real-world usage.

**josh-padnick** commented *Feb 4, 2018*

- Health-checker now outputs to `stdout`, not `stderr`.
- Health checks are now handled in parallel, not serial.
- Additional errors that should have been caught are now explicitly logged where applicable.
- Introduced an env var, `HEALTH_CHECKER_DEBUG`. When set to `true`, health-checker will show the full stack trace on most error messages.

Merging now so I can use in package-kafka. Feedback welcome as always.
