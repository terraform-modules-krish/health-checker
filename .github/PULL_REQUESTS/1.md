# Initial release

Health-checker is designed to be a simple HTTP web server that attempts to connect to one or more ports via TCP when it receives an inbound HTTP request. For more info, see the README in this PR.

The only omission from this PR are automated tests, but those felt relatively cumbersome to write to in proportion to the confidence they built. Opinions on the value of tests, and if applicable, what type of tests would be suitable here are welcome.

I'm going to merge this now so I can make sure my CirlceCI config is working correctly, but feedback is very welcome, and I'll incorporate in a follow-up PR.
