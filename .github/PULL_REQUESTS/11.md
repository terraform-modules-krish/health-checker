The [build](https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/health-checker/518) failed with:

```
error authentication with ECR: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:iam::087285199408:user/_circle-ci-health-checker is not authorized to perform: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken on resource: *
	status code: 400, request id: 7d97c372-03c1-11e9-bdf3-47b25252b6e3
```

I'm not sure what's changed.
