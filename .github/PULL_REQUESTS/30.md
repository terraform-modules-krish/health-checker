# Fix .circleci/config.yml

**eak12913** commented *May 15, 2023*

## Description

The deploy stage of the CircleCI job for this repo was broken. The`build` stage had outdated config for persisting the binary artifacts.

The `deploy` stage was then never mounting the persisted folder and subsequently had errors trying to upload those artifacts to GitHub
