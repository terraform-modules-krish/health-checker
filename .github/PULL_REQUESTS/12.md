# Add script checks

**autero1** commented *Jan 8, 2019*

Purpose of this PR is to document planned changes for adding a capability to execute health check script targets. PR https://github.com/gruntwork-io/health-checker/pull/9 addresses this as part of the changes. 

However, the idea with a smaller change is to have the capability available faster and add the advanced features (such as YAML config) incrementally. Feel free to disagree with the approach :)

Seems the tests have failed since 10 months ago. Will look into it.

Now that I think of it, we might also want to consider adding the HTTP check after all, especially from the ZK point of view. Then we could monitor ZK with a script and Exhibitor with HTTP.

Does it make more sense to find a way to specify more than one script and then the script can do a simple CURL call itself?

Definitely doable, we already support specifying multiple `--port` numbers, so that would work for the `--script` as well. Probably will have to parallelise the script executions in case there are more scripts to run.

Agreed. You can see how I originally handled parallelization [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/health-checker/blob/master/server/server.go#L44-L57).

This is now pretty much done and ready for review. I think the test now cover most of the use cases, including the unhappy paths.
